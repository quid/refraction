`react-expandable-table` is a simple yet powerful table component.

Its main features include: windowed rendering, pagination, row expansion on click,
header tooltips, and sorting.

It can be easily styled by overriding the Emotion `theme`, or by importing
and using as selectors all the components exported by the library.
(they can be found in the `src/styles.js` file for reference)
