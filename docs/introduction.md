Welcome to the Quid UI styleguide.

> _Quid puts the worldâ€™s information at your fingertips. It draws connections between big ideas, giving your brain more power than you ever dreamed possible._

This is the home of all the **open source** UI libraries created at [Quid](https://www.quid.com).

The goal of this project is to make available to the community the technologies we developed
during our day-to-day work on our web applications.

This includes several **standalone libraries** and utilities built to be highly reusable, but also
most of the UI elements that compose our own web apps, such as buttons, icons, inputs, etc...

The libraries we think are going to be more useful to the community have a **"Community"** badge near them!

The packages live in a single monorepo, but they are published individually to npm, so feel free
to install only the ones you need!
